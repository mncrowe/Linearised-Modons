# Linearised-Modons
Julia scripts for studying the linear instabilities of modons.

- full_modon.jl - uses GeophysicalFlows.jl to simulate the full evolution of an initially imposed modon
- linear_modon.jl - used FourierFlows.jl to simulate the linear and nonlinear evolution of perturbations around a modon background state
